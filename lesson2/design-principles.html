               In this classy website, your eye is first drawn to the picture of 
               a homey living space. The next thing I noticed was
               the logo, which is also very classy and eye-catching. Even the way
               it is slightly cut off at the top is visually appealing. Next, you 
               may notice the subscription button at the bottom of the page. Last 
               you may notice the navigation bar, or the free consultation button 
               near the bottom. This sight did a good job of catching your eye with
               a photo, then imprinting their logo into your mind.

               This website has a lot of white space. Although some might consider it
               too much, I think it works for the theme and style of the website. There is
               white space between almost everything on the page. The photos are the 
               only thing that run together, but that draws you in even more. The site
               also looks clean. It has very few words, but still all the information
               you need on the main page of a t-shirt website. I think the centered logo
               and navigation bar also work with the style of the website, even though
               that is not the typical way of doing things.

               OMSI's website is very visually appealing. It has beautiful photos and very
               little useless information. On this page for the Exquisite Creatures exibit,
               they use proximity to define different sections of the page. The information 
               about the exibit and how to get tickets are grouped together. The navigation 
               bar is clearly separated from the rest of the page. The photo, which is related
               to the exibit content is still set apart so it can draw your eye with visual 
               hierarchy. There is a note at the bottom about membership that is close to
               the ticket information button, because it directly relates to ticket pricing.
